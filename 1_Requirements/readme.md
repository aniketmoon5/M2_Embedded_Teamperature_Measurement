## Introduction
In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring temperature. This circuit is developed using “LM35”, a linear voltage sensor. Temperature is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faraheite”. “LM35” sensor provides output based on scale of centigrade.

LM35 is three pin transistor like device. It has VCC, GND and OUTPUT. This sensor provides variable voltage at the output based on temperature.

What: Heated seats can make cars much more comfortable in the winter, or for those who often get cold even in the summer. The heater in most vehicles work well, but the car's seat warmer is close to your body allowing you to warm up faster. In some cases, the seat warms up before the rest of the vehicle does.

When: Heated front seats not only offer luxurious comfort, relaxation and benefits for physical health, but also increase safety. Heating seats and backrests ensures a high level of well-being and prevents a cramped posture. Winter clothes limiting freedom of movement can be dispensed with. This also results in better operation of the restraint system by reducing the slack in safety belts. People with back or kidney problems benefit from a possible reduction of pain. It is mostly used in cars.

Where: Mostly In car

Why: Heated seats can bring a lot of different benefits beyond just having a nice and warm place to sit. The single greatest benefit that heated seats can bring is the therapeutic warmth it offers. This is great for older drivers or people with a few aches and pains.

How: The longer the seat cushion stays on, the hotter it gets. If it were to stay on for too long, it would get hot enough to become uncomfortable or even dangerous to sit in. It could even start a fire in the cushion. To prevent this, most car seat heaters have a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature in the cushion. When it reaches a certain temperature, the thermostat sends a signal, automatically turning off the relay until the seat cools down a bit. At that point, the thermostat turns the relay back on again. Many seat cushions also have “high” and “low” settings that let the driver control the temperature of the seat cushions.
