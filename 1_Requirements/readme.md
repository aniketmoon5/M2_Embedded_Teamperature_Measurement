## Introduction
In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring temperature. This circuit is developed using “Atmega328”, a linear voltage sensor. Temperature is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faraheite”.And used the SimuleIDE Software


# **Features:**

- Low Cost 
- Checks if the driver is seated or not.
- Can modify the temperature according to the passenger.
- Robust System

## Details requirements
### High Level Requirements:
| ID | Description | 
|----| ------------| 
|HLR1  | When the two switches are closed, the first LED glows indicating the actuation of the system and the heater. | 
|HLR2  | Analog input from the temperature sensor | 
|HLR3  | Display. |		

#### Low Level Requirements:

| ID | Description |
|-------|------|
| LLR1 | ADC with Pulse Width Modulation.| 
| LLR2 | Compatible on different Operating Systems. |

# **SWOT Analysis:**

**Strength:**

- Temperature modification can be done easily.
- Cost effective.
- Heat generation is fast.

**Weakness:**
- Need dry bags to store the heater.
- Mostly applicable in countries with low temperature.
- Not water proof.

**Opportunities:**

-By implementing both heater and AC.

**Threats:**
- Can't use in high temperature areas.
- High electrical resistance could cause the heater pad in the seat to overheat.

# **4W and 1H:**

**Why:**
To maintain the heat in the vehicles in cold weather.

**What:**
Temperature measurement system to measure,control and generate heat.

**Where:**
Automotive Industry.

**When:**
In vehicles at low temperature areas.

**How:**
By installing the system in vehicles.
